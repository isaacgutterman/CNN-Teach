This is a repository that I made for teaching about Convolutional Neural Networks

In this repository you will find a data set split into train and test along with a model.py that will train a model

After training for an example of the possibilities I combined the power of the small CNN I trained (due to computing power)
with the openai LLM to sumarize data obtained by the CNN from emotional analysis
